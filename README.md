## SilverWare - Sean's Beta65s Lite Tune

The purpose for this version of the firmware is to enable certain features available in the NotFastEnuf version of Silverware at a lighter weight specifically to work on my Beta65s Lite drone.

What was happening to me was the NFE version wasn't working correctly (my drone would flash, but yaw uncontrollably when "armed" and given a little throttle). This might have been because of some setting that was there, that I didn't set up correctly, but it was difficult to debug, so I', starting over from the root (Boldclash BWHOOP B03) and adding features from there.

Here's what I'm shooting for and what's working.

### Here's what's working:

- Use transmitter switch for acro/level modes
- More aggressive rates in acro/level mode

### Here's what's partially working:

- Arming Mode (Doesn't actually toggle on/off, but LED's flash)
- LED toggle on transmitter switch (Have to switch on before switching off)
- Yaw fix after flips/rolls - There's something here that doesn't work well on flips that I need to debug

### Here's what I want to have, that doesn't work at all yet

- Horizon Mode
- Auto Bind - I have the code in there for this, but for some reason it doesnt work yet.
- Overclocking

## SilverWare - BoldClash BWHOOP B-03 version

_Also works with B03 Pro_

Currently does not account for centered throttle! ( no altitude hold ) It uses normal throttle, low = motors off. That means it should be used with Devo / multimodule or another tx.

Programming connector is a Microjst 1.25 pitch connector. Don't wire positive to st-link as you may overcharge the battery if connected or damage the st-link.

### Level / acro mode change
By default "gestures" are used to change modes, move the stick *left-left-down* for acro mode , and *right-right-down* for level mode.

### Pid gestures and save
Pid gestures allow the pilot to change the acro mode pids by a percentage, and such tune the quadcopter without a computer. The new pids can be saved so that they will be restored after the quad is power cycled.The new pids will remain active if saved, until the pid values in file pid.c are changed. If the values are not changed, flashing the quad will not erase the pids unless the erase command is manually issued when programming.

### Accel calibration / pid save
The gesture for accel calibration is down - down - down. If pids have been changed using the respective gestures since the last powerup or save, the pids will be saved instead.

### Telemetry
DeviationTx and multimodule+taranis can support telemetry, this requires no changes from the defaults on the quad. For devo, when selecting the Bayang protocol, hit Enter to see options, and enable telemetry there. Telemetry currently contains received number of data and telemetry packets, and 2 voltages, battery raw voltage and compensated voltage ( against voltage drop )

For multimodule, you need to add telemetry ( as an option ) to the bayang protocol in the protocol table ( configuration file ). Note the telemetry protocol won't work with stock quads.

### Android App telemetry
The Android app "SilverVISE" by SilverAG (not me) is able to receive telemetry from the quad using BLE packets. To use, the app protocol should be set in the quadcopter. The app will also show the pids.

### Linux/gcc version
The gcc version compiles close to 16k, and may need turning off features in order to make it fit. It's also possible to flash up to 32K with changes. Read __install.md__ for additional information. 

The boldclash settings may need changes to work with gcc well. Turn off the software lpf filters except the last 2, the loop time is longer, at 1400, which affects the frequency of other soft lpf filters. You could set loop time to 1500 but it may not be needed.

### 01.18
* 2 new D term filters, 1st and 2nd order with custom frequency
* improved led flash timing
* the throttle smooth feature is gone 
* nrf24 support added, bayang protocol + telemetry
* softi2c support for 1 pullup only ( e011 )

### 29.08.17
* moved flash save to 31k
* added 2 looptime independent soft lpf
* added lowerthrottlemix3 from h8
* added motor filter 2 replacing original,much better performance
* pid save has own led flash now
* cleanup of unused features: headless and some other


### xx.06.17
* pid gestures - pids can be changed by gestures at the field
* pid save - new pids are saved to flash by the d-d-d gesture

### 02.05.17
* level pid is tuned more aggressive
* added filter between level pid and  acro pid
* fixed issue where "Overclock" option broke level mode (i2c) - overclock can be used on the bwhoop now
* removed level mode I term - this was not usually used
* minor cleanup and efficiency
* GCC autovdrop now functional
* LVC throttle lowering disabled by default just in case it malfunctions

### initial changes

* autovdrop improved, and better compensation
* new measured motor curve at 24K pwm
* added a new way of lowering throttle below a certain voltage
* lvc now flashes below an "uncompensated" voltage, too, just in case
